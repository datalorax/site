      <description>This is, basically, the third post in a series of posts about estimating and, now, exploring achievement gap variation between schools. The first post described the method, while the second applied the method to estimate achievement gaps for all schools reporting data on students coded as Hispanic and White in California. That post included some preliminary explorations of the data, but this post will take that further by looking at the variance geographically.</description>

      <description>Intro One of the neatest things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about in the last few years is how to estimate effect sizes from coarsened data. The original article discussed using the method with publicly available data reported by statewide education agencies, and that&amp;rsquo;s the approach I&amp;rsquo;ll use here too. But more generally, the method could be applied in any situation in which a continuous distribution is reported out in ordinal bins.</description>
