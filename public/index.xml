      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;m at the Seattle branch of the Summer Institute on Computational Social Science. Today, we discussed digital trace data and spent some time thinking about different sources of digital trace data. One of the easiest sources is twitter, and thanks to Mike Kearney, it&amp;rsquo;s easily accessible in R via the {rtweet} package!
I joined a group addressing a topic I find myself dwelling on throughout the day - the immigration crisis at the border.</description>

      <description>I gave a lightning talk (slides here) this past weekend at the second annual Cascadia R Conference that was focused on creating and contributing new themes to the {xaringan} package, which is essentially a really well thought out and well-organized R Markdown wrapper around the remark.js package for producing beautiful HTML slides. At the end of that talk, I announced the work-in-progress version of my new R package, {slidex}, for converting Microsoft PowerPoint slides to R Markdown, and specifically {xaringan}, with a single function.</description>

      <description>On April 10, 2018, I gave a talk entitled Developing your first R package: A case study with esvis for the Eugene R Users Group. Although I discussed my esvis package, the focus of the talk was really on tools and tips for developing R pacakges. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over some of the content in that talk, and discuss why I think you should develop an R package.</description>

      <description>This post has needed to be writtend for a little while, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with the actual work of redesigning my website (in fact, I have a number of posts that are backlogged). This post will have a little bit of code (all of it CSS, rather than R), but mostly it&amp;rsquo;s just about my journey and things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.

      <description>In this post I basically just wanted to share some recent developments that I&amp;rsquo;ve made to my personal R package {sundry}. All of the recent advancements have been made to work with the tidyverse, so things like group_by should work seamlessly. If you feel like giving the package a whirl, I&amp;rsquo;d love any feedback you have or bugs you may find. At this point the package is only on github.</description>

      <description>A relatively routine process for me is to combine multiple files into a single data frame by row. For example, the data might be stored in separate CSV files by grade and content area, but I want to load them all and treat it as a single data frame with a grade and content indicator. A good default for this sort of process, is to keep all the variables that are present in any data file, and pad with missingness for the files that don&amp;rsquo;t have that specific variable.</description>

      <title>esvis: Binned Effect Size Plots</title>
      <link>/post/esvis-binned-effect-size-plots/</link>

      <guid>/post/esvis-binned-effect-size-plots/</guid>
      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share one of the more unique plots from esvis - the binned effect size plot. The overall purpose of the binned effect size plot is to evaluate if the differences between two distributions are consistent across the scale. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with a quick example from the package, and then move to a simulated data example.
Quick example The API for esvis is consistent across functions, so we use the same outcome ~ predictor forumula as the first argument, followed by the data for all functions.</description>

      <title>Alluvial Diagrams with ggforce</title>

      <guid>/post/alluvial-plots-with-ggforce/</guid>
      <description>Today I wanted to quickly share my first real attempt at making an alluvial diagram. For those not familiar (and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t previously) an alluvial diagram is a type of flow plot that is essentially equivalent to a sankey diagram. The difference is that while sankey diagrams show flow for different categorical variables, alluvial plots show change over time. To produce the alluvial diagram below, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the development version of the excellent ggforce package written by Thomas Lin Pedersen, who&amp;rsquo;s not only incredibly talented, but also a good follow on twitter.</description>

      <guid>/post/mapping-statewide-school-ratings-with-us-census-tracts/</guid>
      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some work related to geo-spatial mapping, statewide school ratings, and US Census Bureau data using census tracts. Specifically, I wanted to investigate whether there was a relation between the median housing price in an area, and the statewide achievement ratings for schools in the corresponding area. There is a strong relation between socio-economic status and student achievement, but less is known about how statewide ratings for schools relate to the demographics of the corresponding area.</description>

      <description>This is the first of a series of posts to introduce my new esvis R package, why I think it&amp;rsquo;s important, and some of its capabilities. As of this writing the current version on CRAN is 0.0.1, so it&amp;rsquo;s obviously still fresh and may have some bugs. If you find any, please let me know. You can install the package like you would any other on R
install.packages(&amp;quot;esvis&amp;quot;)  or if you&amp;rsquo;d prefer the sometimes buggy but more feature-heavy development version, install from github with devtools.</description>

      <description>I work as a research associate for Behavioral Research and Teaching, a grant-based center in the College of Education at the University of Oregon. My career in research began in measurement and psychometrics and I still do consulting work in that area. However, my research focus has mostly moved towards data science and the economics of education. In other words, I am interested in the intersection of computer programming and statistics, as applied to large-scale data, to understand macro-level features of the educational system (e.</description>

      <description>Author I have authored the following R packages.
esvis Anderson, D. (2017). esvis: Visualization and Estimation of Effect Sizes. R package version 0.1.0. CRAN GitHub
The purpose of esvis is primarily to visualize differences in two or more distributions. It is an implementation and extension of ideas discussed by Andrew Ho (see, for example, here). Non-parametric methods for effects sizes are also implemented. For an introduction to the package, see here.</description>

      <description>COE Data Science Specialization  I am currently in the process of leading the development of a five-course data science specialization in R for students in the College of Education at the University of Oregon, in collaboration with Drs. Alison Hill, Chester Ismay and Andrew Bray. Although the courses will be offered through the COE, it is anticipated that students from numerous social science departments will have an interest, given past enrollment in the R courses listed below.</description>

      <description>em { font-style: italic }   strong { font-weight: bold; }   Tidy data is particularly important for ggplot2 because the job of ggplot2 is to map variables to visual properties: if your data isn’t tidy, you’ll have a hard time visualising it.

      <description>The esvis package is designed to visually compare two or more distributions across the entirety of the scale, rather than only by measures of central tendency (e.g., means). There are also some functions for estimating effect size, including Cohen&amp;rsquo;s d, Hedges&amp;rsquo; g, percentage above a cut, transformed (normalized) percentage above a cut, the area under the curve (conceptually equivalent to the probability that a randomly selected individual from Distribution A has a higher value than a randomly selected individual from Distribution B), and the V statistic, which essentially transforms the area under the curve to standard deviation units (see Ho, 2009).</description>
