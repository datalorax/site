      <description>Today I wanted to quickly share my first real attempt at making an alluvial diagram. For those not familiar (and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t previously) an alluvial diagram is a type of flow plot that is essentially equivalent to a sankey diagram. The difference is that while sankey diagrams show flow for different categorical variables, alluvial plots show change over time. To produce the alluvial diagram below, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the development version of the excellent ggforce package written by Thomas Lin Pedersen, who&amp;rsquo;s not only incredibly talented, but also a good follow on twitter.</description>
