<p>In this post, I&rsquo;d like to share some work related to geo-spatial mapping,
statewide school ratings, and US Census Bureau data using census tracts.
Specifically, I wanted to investigate whether there was a relation between the
median housing price in an area, and the statewide achievement ratings for
schools in the corresponding area. There is a
<a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/media/users/lec321/Sirin_Articles/Sirin_2005.pdf">strong relation</a>
between socio-economic status and student achievement, but less is known about
how statewide ratings for schools relate to the demographics of the
corresponding area. Fair warning - this is a rather long post, so you&rsquo;ll have to have a bit
of endurance to get through it all (I considered splitting it into two posts
but it felt less cohesive). We&rsquo;ll be using R to produce the following map.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>

<p>For this project, I wanted to use only publicly available data. I meandered
around the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) website for a while and eventually
came to the file I wanted: <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/ode/schools-and-districts/reportcards/reportcards/Pages/Accountability-Measures.aspx">Report Card Ratings for each school</a>.
So let&rsquo;s import the data directly from the ODE website, clean it up a bit, and
take a look.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r"># load packages for data import/prep

            clean_names()

<p>In the above code, we import the ratings, filter for only schools in Portland
School District, spread the data out so we have different columns for each type
of rating (achievement, growth, and student subgroup growth), and then select
only the two variables we really need - the school name and the achievement
rating.</p>

<p>This is a good start, but we don&rsquo;t yet have the geographical coordinates of the
schools. To do that, we&rsquo;ll get another dataset from ODE that has the physical
address of each school. We&rsquo;ll then transform those addresses to lattitude and
longitude using a bit of help from the <em>ggmap</em> package
First, the addresses:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">addresses &lt;- import(&quot;http://www.ode.state.or.us/pubs/labels/SchoolMail.xls&quot;,
                    setclass = &quot;tbl_df&quot;) %&gt;% 
  clean_names() %&gt;% 
  filter(city == &quot;PORTLAND&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(name = str_to_title(name)) %&gt;% 
  unite(address, c(address, city, state, zip), sep = &quot; &quot;) %&gt;% 
  select(name, address)
              
addresses

## # ... with 135 more rows
</code></pre>

<p>After import, we limit to only schools in Portland because we&rsquo;re going to be
joining this dataset with our <em>ratings</em> dataset based on the school name, and
we want to ensure we don&rsquo;t join the data for schools with the same name but
but different districts. Unfortunately, the <em>addresses</em> file doesn&rsquo;t tell us the
district, or we could include that as one of the keyed variables in our join.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll now join the <em>addresses</em> dataset with our <em>ratings</em> dataset.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">d &lt;- inner_join(achievement, addresses, by = c(&quot;school_name&quot; = &quot;name&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can find the longitude and lattitude of each school using the physical
address with the help of the <em>ggmap</em> package and, specifically, the <code>geocode</code>
function. This takes a bit of time. Notice I&rsquo;ve changed the source from the default, which is google, to &ldquo;dsk&rdquo;, which uses <a href="http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org">data science toolkit</a> instead. I like this better because it tends to provide better results, at least in my experience, unless their servers are being overwhelmed (which is not terrifically infrequent), in which case it fails catastrophically.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">library(ggmap)
lat_long &lt;- geocode(d$address, source = &quot;dsk&quot;)
d &lt;- bind_cols(d, lat_long)
d[ ,c(1, 4:5)]
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-r">## # A tibble: 81 x 3
##    school_name                     lon   lat
##    &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 Abernethy Elementary School    -123  45.5
##  2 Ainsworth Elementary School    -123  45.5
##  3 Alameda Elementary School      -123  45.5
##  4 Arleta Elementary School       -123  45.5
##  5 Astor Elementary School        -123  45.6
##  6 Atkinson Elementary School     -123  45.5
##  7 Rosa Parks Elementary School   -123  45.6
##  8 Beach Elementary School        -123  45.6
##  9 Beaumont Middle School         -123  45.5
## 10 Boise-Eliot Elementary School  -123  45.5
## # ... with 71 more rows
</code></pre>

<p>Note - an earlier draft of this post had specified <code>source = &quot;dsk&quot;</code> when running
the <code>geocode</code> function. I was getting some missing values (~19%) when using
google (the default) and I received no missing data with <code>source = &quot;dsk&quot;</code>.
However, it seems the Data Science Toolkit website is fairly frequently
overwhelmed. Last time I tried this it took forever and failed, so I suppose
the best option may depend on the availability of the servers at time you run
the function.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-the-data">Mapping the data</h2>

<p>To map the data, we&rsquo;ll use the <em>leaflet</em> and <em>sf</em> packages. We&rsquo;ll first write a
quick function that tells leaflet what color we want the schools in our map to
appear depending on their statewide achievement rating. We&rsquo;ll make a simple
diverging palette, where low values are red, middle values are white, and high
values are green. These colors must correspond with the possible values for
<code>markerColor</code> from <code>leaflet::awesomeIcons</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">library(leaflet)

get_col &lt;- function(df, indicator) {
  sapply(df[[as.character(indicator)]], function(rating) {
    if(rating == 5) {
      &quot;green&quot;
    } else if(rating == 4) {
      &quot;lightgreen&quot;
    } else if(rating == 3) {
      &quot;white&quot;
    } else if(rating == 2) {
      &quot;lightred&quot;
    } else {
      &quot;red&quot;
    } })
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we&rsquo;ll map the Portland area using a combination of <em>leaflet</em> and the
<em>tidycensus</em> packages to not only produce the map, but color census tracts
according to the median housing income for the tract. Note that you have to have
a US Census API key for these function to work (see
<a href="https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html">here</a>).
Below, I use the  <code>get_acs</code> function from <em>tidycensus</em> package to pull census
tract data for  Multnomah County. The variable argument tells the function
which variable to get data from (see the <code>load_variables</code> function for other
variables). I also filter the data for non-negative values (there was one that
was returning a negative value, I haven&rsquo;t taken the time to track down why yet).</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">library(tidycensus)
pdx_acs &lt;- get_acs(geography = &quot;tract&quot;, 
                     variables = &quot;B25077_001&quot;, 
                     state = &quot;OR&quot;,
                     county = &quot;Multnomah County&quot;,
                     geometry = TRUE) %&gt;% 
  filter(estimate &gt; 0) 
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>pdx_acs</code> object now has data on the median housing cost for all census
tracts in Multnomah County, as well as the geometry of each census tract. We
can use this information to produce the map. First, however, we need to create
a color palette for the tracts. We&rsquo;ll use the viridis palette, which is not
only beautiful, but also good for people with color blindness, as well as for
printing in black and white. We&rsquo;ll use the <code>colorNumeric</code> function from
<em>leaflet</em>, and ask it to fill each tract according to the estimate of the
median housing cost, which we just extracted with the <em>tidycensus</em> package.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">pal &lt;- colorNumeric(palette = &quot;viridis&quot;, 
                    domain = pdx_acs$estimate)
</code></pre>

<p>Next we&rsquo;ll get the actual icons we want to use, coloring them according to
the achievement ratings. The last line in this code gets a hexadecimal
approximation for these colors, which we&rsquo;ll use in a legend later.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">pins &lt;- awesomeIcons(
  icon = 'ios-close',
  iconColor = 'black',
  library = 'ion',
  markerColor = get_col(d, &quot;achievement&quot;)
)

cols &lt;- gplots::col2hex(c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;lightgreen&quot;, &quot;darkgreen&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll produce the map, using the code below. Although it appears
somewhat complicated, it&rsquo;s actually not too bad, it&rsquo;s just rather long(ish).
Essentially we first separate <code>NAME</code> into three distinct variables for the
census tract, county, and state, then we (a) create a blank map, (b) set the
style in which we want the map to render, &copy; add tract information,
(d) add school information, and (e) add legends.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">pdx_acs %&gt;%
  separate(NAME, c(&quot;tract&quot;, &quot;county&quot;, &quot;state&quot;), sep = &quot;,&quot;) %&gt;% 
  leaflet() %&gt;%
  addProviderTiles(provider = &quot;Stamen.TerrainBackground&quot;) %&gt;%
  addPolygons(popup = ~ tract,
              stroke = FALSE,
              smoothFactor = 0,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,
              color = ~ pal(estimate)) %&gt;%
  addAwesomeMarkers(data = d, 
                    ~lon, 
                    ~lat, 
                    icon = pins, 
                    popup= ~school_name) %&gt;% 
  addLegend(&quot;bottomright&quot;, 
            pal = pal, 
            values = ~ estimate,
            title = &quot;Median Home Value&quot;,
            labFormat = labelFormat(prefix = &quot;$&quot;),
            opacity = 1) %&gt;% 
  addLegend(&quot;bottomright&quot;, 
            colors = rev(cols),
            labels = 5:1,
            title = &quot;Achievement Ratings&quot;,
            opacity = 1)
</code></pre>

<iframe seamless src="../2017-11-13-mapping-statewide-school-ratings-with-us-census-tracts_files/map_schools.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

<p>One of the nice things about this map is that it&rsquo;s fully interactive. And
that&rsquo;s particularly helpful here because to really see the relation you&rsquo;ll need
to zoom in quite a bit. Because we added the optional <code>popup</code> argument to
<code>addPolygons</code> and <code>addAwesomeMarkers</code>, we&rsquo;re able to click to identify a
specific census tract or the name of a specific school. If we wanted the plot
to render differently we could change the provider. For example, you could
produce a nice terrain map with <code>provider = &quot;Stamen.TerrainBackground&quot;</code>. All
the different options are available
<a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html">here</a>,
where you can preview a map before applying it to yours.</p>

<p>Note that we have a very clear and very strong relation here - essentially all
the red, pink, and white schools are in the more purple tracts, correpsonding to
lower median housing price areas. This is powerful information but it is
important that it&rsquo;s not confused to mean that the lowest quality schools are
located in the more impoverished areas. This information tells us very little
about the quality of the school and, indeed, if we look at estimates of growth
(shown below without all the code) there is a much less strong correlation. That
is, the ratings schools receive on the amount of growth students make is less
correlated with the median housing cost in the area than is absolute achievement,
although there does still appear to be some correlation.</p>
