# Background
### Content-related validity evidence

--

* One five major sources of validity evidence (as outlined by the [*Standards*](https://www.apa.org/science/programs/testing/standards))


--
* Does the content represented in the test represent the targeted content?
 
  + Are specific areas missing?

  + Are specific areas over-represented?


--
* Operationally, evidence is often gathered through *alignment studies*.

  + Judgments made by panels of experts (educators).

  + Does the test items align with the content standards?


---
# Study purpose
Extend content-related validity evidence through the use of text mining


--
* What thematic topics are represented in the content standards?


--
* How do individual items map on to these topics (if at all)?


--
* What is the overall coverage of the topics across test items?


---
# Topic modeling
* Corpus of words split into *documents*


--
  + We treat each content standard as a document


--
* Latent variables (topics) estimated from word co-occurrence


--
  + Number of topics estimated is determined by the researcher (similar to exploratory factor analysis)


--
* Each document is a mixture of topics
  + `\(\gamma\)` estimates provide probability a given topic is represented within a document

* Each topic is a mixture of words
  + `\(\beta\)` estimates provide probability a given word is represented within a topic

.major-emph-green[The fundamental idea]

--
1. Train a model on the content standards to estimate the latent topics represented therein. 


--
2. Apply the model to the test items to estimate which topics the items represent (based on the text within the item).

---
# Our application
* Science NGSS Performance Expectations

* Grade 8 statewide Alternate Assessment based on Alternate Achievement Standards (AA-AAS)

  + Designed for students with the .bolder[most] significant cognitive disabilities.

  + 1% reporting cap

  + Reduced in depth, breadth, and complexity 

---
# Analyses

* Topics estimated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
  + Common stop words removed ("and", "of", "the", etc.)
  + Webb's DOK verbs removed ("choose", "describe", "find")


--
* Four methods evaluated to determine optimal number of topics (2-25 evaluated)
  + Arun et al. (2010): KL-Divergence
  + Cao et al. (2009): Cosine similarity
  + Deveaud et al. (2014): Jensen Shannon distance
  + Griffiths &amp; Sayers (2004): harmonic mean of posterior log-likelihoods


--
* Smaller range of topics evaluated by two science content experts for substantive meaning

# Results: `\(n\)` topics

* 3-6 topics evaluated for substantive meaning

* 5-topic solution independently arrived upon

  + Distinct topics, little redundancy

# Topic coverage

---
# Discussion
* Content validity is a critical component of "overall evaluative judgment" (Messick, 1995) of the validity of test-based inferences


--
* Particularly important within standards-based educational systems


--
* Text-modeling may serve as additional source of evidence (triangulation)


--
* May be useful as a diagnostic tool


---
# Limitations &amp; Future Directions

* Results depend upon chosen topic model - different models may lead to different inferences


--
* Our model is preliminary, but publicly available. Consensus from field could help inform models that are useful and provide better validity evidence.


--
* Our application was in Science with an AA-AAS

  + Generalizability to other content areas/tests is not known


--
* What if an item has no text?
  
  + Text-modeling could perhaps be used to help "flag" items for further investigation

  + Alternative ML procedures (e.g., image recognition) may help


---
# Conclusions

* Text mining procedures may provide additional source of evidence

  + Perhaps supplementing formal alignment studies

* Evidence could be used diagnostically

* Topic modeling itself may be useful in understanding the topics represented in either the standards or a given test, indpendent of the linkage between the two.
