# Study 1: Measurement
### Gauging Item Alignment Through Online Systems While Controlling for Rater Effects

.footnote[Anderson, D., Irvin, P. S., Alonzo, J., &amp; Tindal, G. A. (2015). Gauging item alignment through online systems while controlling for rater effects. *Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice*, *34*, 22-33. doi: [10.1111/emip.12038](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/emip.12038)]

---
# Item-Standard Alignment
* Critical to standards-based assessment and accountability
* Provides a source of content-related validity evidence


--
### General Approach
* Panel or independent reviews
* Collapse ratings using simple averages or consensus-based methods


--
### Study purpose
* Apply latent trait methods to optimally combine scores &amp; statistically document &amp; control for rater effects

# Scaling model
Adapted from the Many Facets Rasch Model, defined as 

.Large[
$$
ln\Biggl(\frac{P\_{nijk}}{P\_{ni(k-1)j}}\Biggr) = B\_n - D\_i - F\_k - C\_j
$$

]

--

Where
* `\(P_{nijk}\)` is the probability that person `\(n\)` is rated into category `\(k\)` on
  item `\(i\)` by rater `\(j\)`
* `\(B_n\)` is the estimated location on the latent trait for person `\(n\)`
* `\(D_i\)` is the difficulty of item `\(i\)`
* `\(F_k\)` is the threshold for the `\(k-1\)` category
* `\(C_j\)` is the severity/harshness of of rater `\(j\)`

---
# Scaling model
* Prior equation (general MFRM model) estimates latent variables for persons,
  items, item thresholds, and raters


--
* Our case includes item, rater, and rater threshold parameters

* Redefining the subscripts so that the `\(n\)` and `\(i\)`  index items and raters
  respectively 

--

.Large[
$$
ln\Biggl(\frac{P\_{nik}}{P\_{ni(k-1)}}\Biggr) = B\_n - D\_i - F\_k
$$
]

* `\(B_n\)` is the latent alignment rating for item `\(n\)`
* `\(D_i\)` is the severity/harshness of of rater `\(i\)`
* `\(F_k\)` is the category-specific severity/harshness estimate

# Discussion
* Online designs (in many study contexts) are an efficient means of data
  collection, .red[**BUT**]


--
* When data need to be pooled/collapsed across respondents/raters, latent
  trait/item response theory methods can help

--
* Generally, thinking about data collection through the lens of scaling and
  equating can help make results more interpretable (common metric) and
  potentially increase statistical power.


--
* More sophisticated analyses can provide additional information, which can
  help aid interpretation and decisions


--
* Specific application here had some limitations (e.g., small number of raters,
  leading to larger standard errors), but the methodology should generalize.

# Study 2: Individual Differences
### Exploring Teacher and School Variance in Students’ Within-Year Reading and Mathematics Growth.

.footnote[Anderson, D. (revise and resubmit). Exploring Teacher and School
Variance in Students’ Within-Year Reading and Mathematics Growth. *School
Effectiveness and School Improvement*]

---
# The fundamental question
* We know there is considerable heterogeneity in the rate at which students 
  learn.


--
.major-emph-red[Why?]


--
* Lots of evidence that teachers contribute to learning


--
* Lots of evidence that schools contribute to learning


--
**How much does student learning depend on the set of teachers they are
"assigned" to, versus schools?**

--
### Secondary questions
* Is evidence of teacher "sorting" between schools present?
* How variable is the "summer slide"?

---
# Data 

* 3 Cohorts of students in one school district in the Southwestern United 
  States, progressing from Grades 3-5

  + 2007-08 to 2009-10, 2008-09 to 2010-11, or 2009-10 to 2011-12


--
* Three time points within each year (collected fall, winter, spring)


--
* Variance components estimated for teachers in each grade, necessitating the
  removal of any student with incomplete teacher records.

  + 2,909 students out 5,311 had complete teacher records


--
* Between 106-119 teachers, depending on the grade, nested in 18 schools


--
* Approximately 54% of students were coded as Hispanic, 24% White, and 74% were
  eligible for free or reduced price lunch

---
# Measures
* Measures of Academic Progress, developed by the Northwest Evaluation
  Association (NWEA)

* Computer adaptive 

  + High conditional reliability across a broad ability range

* Vertical scale

  + Growth within and between grades directly comparable

---
# Piecewise growth model

### Slopes
$$
g3\_{slp} = {0, 1, 2 | 2, 2, 2 | 2, 2, 2} \\\
g4\_{slp} = {0, 0, 0 | 0, 1, 2 | 2, 2, 2} \\\
g5\_{slp} = {0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 0 | 0, 1, 2}
$$

--

### Grade 4 &amp; 5 Intercepts
$$
g4 = {0, 0, 0 | 1, 1, 1 | 1, 1, 1} \\\
g5 = {0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 0 | 1, 1, 1}
$$

--
### Fixed effects

$$
y\_{tijk} = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1(g3\_{slp}) + \beta\_2(g4) + \beta\_3(g4\_{slp}) + \beta\_4(g5) + \beta\_5(g5\_{slp}) 
$$


---
# Random effects

### Student level (nested)

$$ 
`\begin{pmatrix}
  r_{0_{ijk}} + r_{1_{ijk}}(g3_{slp}) + \\\  
  r_{2_{ijk}}(g4) + r_{3_{ijk}}(g4_{slp}) + \\\
  r_{4_{ijk}}(g5) + r_{5_{ijk}}(g5_{slp})
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

### Teacher level (crossed)

$$ 
`\begin{pmatrix}
  u_{0_{j(3)k}}^3 + u_{1_{j(3)k}}^3(g3_{slp}) 
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

$$
`\begin{pmatrix}
  u_{2_{j(4)k}}^4 + u_{3_{j(4)k}}^4(g4_{slp}) 
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

$$
`\begin{pmatrix}
  u_{4_{j(5)k}}^4 + u_{5_{j(5)k}}^4(g5_{slp}) 
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

---
# Random effects

### School level (nested)

$$ 
`\begin{pmatrix}
  v_{0_{k}} + v_{1_{k}}(g3_{slp}) + \\\  
  v_{2_{k}}(g4) + v_{3_{k}}(g4_{slp}) + \\\
  v_{4_{k}}(g5) + v_{5_{k}}(g5_{slp})
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

### Residual error

&lt;br/&gt;

All random effects were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution 
and were estimated with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix

.footnote[For reading, the variance-covariance matrix at the school level was
moderately simplified to help the model converge. Specifically, the 
school-level intercept and all slope terms were allowed to correlate, but the
correlation between these terms and the summer drops were fixed at zero.]

# Conclusions
* Considerable variability in students' growth was between **both** teachers
  and schools


--
* Teacher/School effects may compound, or compensate


--
* Considerable variability in "high growth" teachers in all schools


--
* Several limitations should be kept in mind
  + small number of schools for the complexity of the model
  + Students had to have at least one data point within each school year to be
    included (mobility is linked with achievement and SES)

# "Epidemiological" work
* Large-scale data sources incorporated with educational outcomes

* Predict "disease" (e.g., achievement gaps)

* Include different modeling strategies (e.g., machine learning)

* Ideally, data are publicly available/shareable

  + Increase transparency/reproducibility

# Wrapping up

---
# Future Work
* The work presented here was mostly exploratory/visual - can we actually model
  the data with machine learning methods?


--
* Given recent gains in computational methods, can we expand what "counts" as
  data? (e.g., images)

---
# Conference proposal

* Train a text-based machine learning algorithm on a set of content standards.

* Extract any textual features from the item and allow the model to classify
  the item (new/additional source of content-related validity evidence)

* Embedded within all my teaching

* Recently applied for small grant to help navigate between R Markdown and
  Microsoft Word

* Deeply committed to open and transparent research
