* Variance in summer lags (out-of-school opportunities)


--
### Study 2: Variance in intervention effects
* Regression Discontinuity Design
* Cluster-level design; treatment delivered at the school level
* Evaluations of functional form are critical


--

# Study 1: Variance in students' within-year growth
### Exploring Teacher and School Variance in Students’ Within-Year Reading and Mathematics Growth.

.footnote[Anderson, D. (conditional acceptance). Exploring Teacher and School
Variance in Students’ Within-Year Reading and Mathematics Growth. *School
Effectiveness and School Improvement*]

---
# The fundamental question
* We know there is considerable heterogeneity in the rate at which students 
  learn.


--
.major-emph-orange[Why?]


--
* Lots of evidence that teachers contribute to learning


--
* Lots of evidence that schools contribute to learning


--
**How much does student learning depend on the set of teachers they are
"assigned" to, versus schools?**

--
### Secondary questions
* Is evidence of teacher "sorting" between schools present?
* How variable is the "summer slide"?

---
# Data 

* 3 Cohorts of students in one school district in the Southwestern United 
  States, progressing from Grades 3-5

  + 2007-08 to 2009-10, 2008-09 to 2010-11, or 2009-10 to 2011-12


--
* Three time points within each year (collected fall, winter, spring)


--
* Variance components estimated for teachers in each grade, necessitating the
  removal of any student with incomplete teacher records.

  + 2,909 students out 5,311 had complete teacher records


--
* Between 106-119 teachers, depending on the grade, nested in 18 schools


--
* Approximately 54% of students were coded as Hispanic, 24% White, and 74% were
  eligible for free or reduced price lunch

---
# Measures
* Measures of Academic Progress, developed by the Northwest Evaluation
  Association (NWEA)

* Computer adaptive 

  + High conditional reliability across a broad ability range

* Vertical scale

  + Growth within and between grades directly comparable

---
# Piecewise growth model

### Slopes
$$
g3\_{slp} = {0, 1, 2 | 2, 2, 2 | 2, 2, 2} \\\
g4\_{slp} = {0, 0, 0 | 0, 1, 2 | 2, 2, 2} \\\
g5\_{slp} = {0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 0 | 0, 1, 2}
$$

--

### Grade 4 &amp; 5 Intercepts
$$
g4 = {0, 0, 0 | 1, 1, 1 | 1, 1, 1} \\\
g5 = {0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 0 | 1, 1, 1}
$$

--
### Fixed effects

$$
y\_{tijk} = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1(g3\_{slp}) + \beta\_2(g4) + \beta\_3(g4\_{slp}) + \beta\_4(g5) + \beta\_5(g5\_{slp}) 
$$


---
# Random effects

### Student level (nested)

$$ 
`\begin{pmatrix}
  r_{0_{ijk}} + r_{1_{ijk}}(g3_{slp}) + \\\  
  r_{2_{ijk}}(g4) + r_{3_{ijk}}(g4_{slp}) + \\\
  r_{4_{ijk}}(g5) + r_{5_{ijk}}(g5_{slp})
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

### Teacher level (crossed)

$$ 
`\begin{pmatrix}
  u_{0_{j(3)k}}^3 + u_{1_{j(3)k}}^3(g3_{slp}) 
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

$$
`\begin{pmatrix}
  u_{2_{j(4)k}}^4 + u_{3_{j(4)k}}^4(g4_{slp}) 
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

$$
`\begin{pmatrix}
  u_{4_{j(5)k}}^4 + u_{5_{j(5)k}}^4(g5_{slp}) 
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

---
# Random effects

### School level (nested)

$$ 
`\begin{pmatrix}
  v_{0_{k}} + v_{1_{k}}(g3_{slp}) + \\\  
  v_{2_{k}}(g4) + v_{3_{k}}(g4_{slp}) + \\\
  v_{4_{k}}(g5) + v_{5_{k}}(g5_{slp})
\end{pmatrix}`
$$

--

### Residual error

&lt;br/&gt;

All random effects were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution 
and were estimated with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix

.footnote[For reading, the variance-covariance matrix at the school level was
moderately simplified to help the model converge. Specifically, the 
school-level intercept and all slope terms were allowed to correlate, but the
correlation between these terms and the summer drops were fixed at zero.]

# Conclusions
* Considerable variability in students' growth was between **both** teachers
  and schools


--
* Teacher/School effects may compound, or compensate


--
* Generally a mix of high/low growth teachers within each school


--
* Several limitations should be kept in mind
  + Small number of schools for the complexity of the model
  + Students had to have at least one data point within each school year to be
    included (mobility is linked with achievement and SES)

# Study 2: Evaluating School-Provided Interventions

# Background
### Middle School Intervention Project
* Oregon Department of Education launched *Effective Behavioral and Instructional Support System* initiative 

  + MSIP aimed at evaluating its effect

* Multi-tiered systems of support

# Design

.Large[Regression discontinuity (RD)]

* Students scoring below a .bold[school-defined] threshold on a reading composite measure were targeted for intervention

* Fuzzy design by design
  
  + Up to 5% of students could be exempted on either side of the cut


--
*Note: The paper had some planned follow-up post-hoc analyses of between school variability, which I will not discuss in depth here*

# Impact Model

.Large[Multilevel Generalized Additive Model]

### Level 1

$$
y\_{ij} = \beta\_{0j} + \beta\_{1j}(LEC\_{ij}) + s\_1(LEC \times assignVar\_{ij}) + s\_2(AC \times assignVar\_{ij}) + e\_{ij}
$$

--

### Level 2

$$
\beta\_{0j} = \gamma\_{00} + \gamma\_{01}(cut\_j) + u\_{0j}\\\
\beta\_{1j} = \gamma\_{10} + u\_{1j}
$$


--
* `\(s_p =\)` thin-plate spline smooths

  + Degree of smoothing determined via generalized cross-validation


--
* `\(\gamma_{10} =\)` average treatment effect (assuming a sharp design)

--
* `\(u_{1j} =\)` between school variation in the average treatment effect 



---
# Accounting for fuzziness
9% crossovers, 18% no-shows

Two step process to estimate the fuzzy RD gap


--
1. Model probability gap (of treatment receipt)

  + Models equivalent to previous slide, but using multilevel logistic regression


--
1. Divide sharp RD impact estimate, `\(\gamma_{10}\)`, by estimated probability gap


.gray[(standard errors can be similarly transformed)]



---
# RD on State Test

`\(\gamma_{10} = -0.06\)`; `\(\gamma_{10_f} = -0.12, SE_f = 0.72, z_f = -0.16, p_f = 0.87\)`

# Variability

---
# Conclusions

* No significant effect of intervention found

* Small variability in the null effect between schools

--

* Three possible sources of null effect (Seftor, 2017)
  
  + Methodological failure

  + **Implementation failure**

  + *Theory failure*

### In-Progress Research: Computational methods
* Linking large-scale data sources
  + Machine learning approaches 
* Open data, open science, and reproducible research

---
# Open science
* Much recent focus on open data in research generally

* Open data tend to be rare in educational research

  + Privacy concerns


--
.major-emph-orange[NCLB Required Publicly Available Data]


--
* School-level data 

* Percent proficient in each of at least four proficiency categories

* Disaggregated by student subgroups



---
# Reardon &amp; Ho method

# Wrapping up

* Geographic achievement gap variance work presented here was mostly
exploratory/visual
  + Can we actually model the data with machine learning methods?

* IES grant application currently (still) under review under the *Statistical
and Research Methodology Early Career* RFA

### Reproducibility &amp; transparency

* I'm leading a training on reproducible research at AERA this year

* Embedded within all my teaching

* Deeply committed to open and transparent research
