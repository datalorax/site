# Some review
* What is an R function?

--
  
  + Anything that carries out an operation in R, including `+` and `&lt;-`

--

* What are the components of a function?

--

  + .red[Formals] (arguments), .red[Body] (everything between the braces), and .red[Environment] (where the function lives)

# When should you write a function?
### Hadley's rule
&gt; You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code).

# Bundle your functions
Once you've written more than one function, you may want to bundle them. There are two general ways to do this:

--

.pull-left[
.center[.Large[source?]]
] 

.pull-right[
.center[.Large[Write a package]]
]

# Reasons to avoid `source`ing

* Documentation is generally more sparse
* Directory issues

# Background
### Effect sizes
Standardized mean differences

--

* Assumes  reasonably normally distributed distributions (mean is a good indicator of central tendency)

--

* Differences in means may not reflect differences at all points in scale if variances are different

--

* Substantive interest may also lie with differences at other points in the distribution.

---
# Varying differences
### Quick simulated example


```r
library(tidyverse)
common_var &lt;- tibble(low  = rnorm(1000, 10, 1),
                     high = rnorm(1000, 12, 1),
                     var = "common")
diff_var &lt;- tibble(low  = rnorm(1000, 10, 1),
                   high = rnorm(1000, 12, 2),
                   var = "diff")
d &lt;- bind_rows(common_var, diff_var)
head(d)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##     low  high var   
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 
## 1  9.34  11.3 common
## 2 11.4   11.9 common
## 3 10.2   12.7 common
## 4  8.97  10.0 common
## 5  9.09  12.2 common
## 6  9.26  11.5 common
```

---
# Restructure the data for plotting

```r
d &lt;- d %&gt;% 
  gather(group, value, -var) 
d
```

```
## # A tibble: 4,000 x 3
##    var    group value
##    &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 common low    9.34
##  2 common low   11.4 
##  3 common low   10.2 
##  4 common low    8.97
##  5 common low    9.09
##  6 common low    9.26
##  7 common low    9.59
##  8 common low    8.43
##  9 common low   10.4 
## 10 common low    8.54
## # ... with 3,990 more rows
```

---
# Plot the distributions


```r
theme_set(theme_minimal())

ggplot(d, aes(value, color = group)) +
  geom_density(lwd = 1.5) +
  facet_wrap(~var)
```

![](eugene_rug_files/figure-html/plot_dists-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Binned effect sizes

1. Cut the distributions into `\(n\)` bins (based on percentiles)
2. Calculate the mean difference between paired bins
3. Divide each mean difference by the overall pooled standard deviation

$$
d\_{[i]} = \frac{\bar{X}\_{foc\_{[i]}} - \bar{X}\_{ref\_{[i]}}}
        {\sqrt{\frac{(n\_{foc} - 1)Var\_{foc} + (n\_{ref} - 1)Var\_{ref}}
                  {n\_{foc} + n\_{ref} - 2}}}
$$

# Package Creation
### The (a) recipe
1. Come up with .red[~~a brilliant~~] an idea 
  + .small[.grey[can be boring and mundane but just something you do a lot]]
--

2. Write a function! .small[.grey[or more likely, a set of functions]]
--

3. Create package skelton
--

4. Document your function
--

5. Install/fiddle/install
--

6. Write tests for your functions
--

7. Host your package somewhere public .grey[(GitHub is probably best)] and promote it - leverage the power of open source!
--

8. Use tools .grey[(which we'll talk about momentarily)] to help automate many of the steps, and make the whole thing less painful

---
# Some resources 
We surely won't get through all the steps tonight. In my mind, the best resources are:

# Our package
We're going to write a package today! Let's keep it really simple...

1. Idea: Report basic descriptive statistics for a vector, `x`: `n`, `mean`, and `sd`. Let's also have it report on the number of missing observations. 

---
# Our function
* Let's have it return either (a) a named vector, or (b) a dataframe .grey[.small[(whichever you prefer is fine)]]
* What will be the formal arguments?
* What will the body look like?

--
### Want to give it a go?

# The approach I took...


```r
describe &lt;- function(x) {
  n     &lt;- as.integer(length(na.omit(x)))
  nmiss &lt;- as.integer(sum(is.na(x)))
  mn    &lt;- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  stdev &lt;- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  out &lt;- tibble::tibble(n_valid   = n, 
                        n_missing = nmiss, 
                        mean      = mn, 
                        sd        = stdev)
  out
}
```

---
# Informal testing


```r
describe(rnorm(100))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
##   n_valid n_missing   mean    sd
##     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     100         0 0.0732 0.891
```

```r
describe(c(rnorm(1000, 10, 4), rep(NA, 27)))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
##   n_valid n_missing  mean    sd

Package skeleton: 
* `usethis::create_package`
* `usethis::use_r`
* Use `roxygen2` special comments for documentation
* Run `devtools::document`
* Install and restart, play around
]

---
# roxygen2 comments

**Typical arguments**
* `@param`: Describe the formal arguments. State argument name and the describe it.

&gt; `#' @param x Vector to describe`

* `@return`: What does the function return

&gt; `#' @return A tibble with descriptive data`

* `@example` or more commonly `@examples`: Provide examples of the use of your function.
* `@export`: Export your function

If you don't include `@export`, your function will be *internal*, meaning others can't access it easily.

# Other docs

* .bolder[`.gitignore`]: Files to ignore for git commits with some pre-slugged entries
* .bolder[`NAMESPACE`]: Created by **{roxygen2}**. Don't edit it. If you need to, trash it and it will be reproduced. 
* .bolder[`DESCRIPTION`]: Describes your package (more on next slide)

# `DESCRIPTION`
Metadata about the package. Default fields for our package are

# `DESCRIPTION` for {esvis} 

```
Package: esvis
Type: Package
Title: Visualization and Estimation of Effect Sizes
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Daniel", "Anderson", email = "daniela@uoregon.edu", 
	   role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A variety of methods are provided to estimate and visualize
    distributional differences in terms of effect sizes. Particular emphasis
    is upon evaluating differences between two or more distributions across
    the entire scale, rather than at a single point (e.g., differences in
    means). For example, Probability-Probability (PP) plots display the
    difference between two or more distributions, matched by their empirical
    CDFs (see Ho and Reardon, 2012; &lt;doi:10.3102/1076998611411918&gt;), allowing
    for examinations of where on the scale distributional differences are
    largest or smallest. The area under the PP curve (AUC) is an effect-size
    metric, corresponding to the probability that a randomly selected
    observation from the x-axis distribution will have a higher value
    than a randomly selected observation from the y-axis distribution. 
    Binned effect size plots are also available, in which the distributions
    are split into bins (set by the user) and separate effect sizes (Cohen's
    d) are produced for each bin - again providing a means to evaluate the
    consistency (or lack thereof) of the difference between two or more 
    distributions at different points on the scale. Evaluation of empirical 
    CDFs is also provided, with  built-in arguments for providing annotations 
    to help evaluate distributional differences at specific points (e.g., 
    semi-transparent shading). All function take a consistent argument 
    structure. Calculation of specific effect sizes is also possible. The
    following effect sizes are estimable: (a) Cohen's d, (b) Hedges' g, 
    (c) percentage above a cut, (d) transformed (normalized) percentage above 
    a cut, (e)  area under the PP curve, and (f) the V statistic (see Ho, 
    2009; &lt;doi:10.3102/1076998609332755&gt;), which essentially transforms the 
    area under the curve to standard deviation units. By default, effect sizes 
    are calculated for all possible pairwise comparisons, but a reference 
    group (distribution) can be specified.

# Demo
* Change the author name. 
  + Add a contributer just for fun.
* Add a license. We'll go for MIT license using `usethis::use_mit_license("First and Last Name")`
* Install and reload.

---
# Declare dependencies
* The function **depends on** the [{tibble}](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/01/tibble-1-4-2/) package. 
* We have to declare this dependency

--

## My preferred approach
* Create a package documentation page.
  + roxygen parameters: 
    - `#' @doctype Package`
    - `#' @name pkg_name`
* Declare all dependencies for your package there.
* Only import the functions you need - not the entire package
  + Use `#' importFrom pkg fun_name`

# Demo

---
# Write tests!

* What does it mean to write tests?
  + ensure your package does what you expect it to

--

* Why write tests?
  + If you write a new function, and breaks an old one, that's good to know! 
  + Reduces bugs, makes your package code more robust
  
--

* How do you write tests?
  + `usethis::use_testthat` sets up the infrastructure
  + make assertions, e.g.: `testthat::expect_equal()`, `testthat::expect_warning()`, `testthat::expect_error()`

# Check your R package

# A few other best practices
* Create a `README` with `usethis::use_readme_rmd`.

--

* Try to get your [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) up above 80%.

--

* Automate wherever possible ({devtools} and {usethis} help a lot with this)

--

* Use the [{goodpractice}](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) package to help you package code be more robust, specifically with `goodpractice::gp()`. It will give you lots of good ideas

--

* Host on GitHub, and capitalize on integration with other systems (all free, but require registering for an account)

### Why you should use git and GitHub

---
class: center middle

&lt;i class="fa fa-github fa-5x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
# [esvis](https://github.com/DJAnderson07/esvis)

---
# Quickly
* Get started with `usethis::use_git`, followed by `usethis::use_github`.

&gt; For this to work, you’ll need to set a GITHUB_PAT environment variable in your ~/.Renviron. Follow [Jenny Bryan’s](http://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html#step-by-step) instructions, and use `edit_r_environ()` to easily access the right file for editing


.green[Note: I haven't played around with this much. Standard git procedures will work too.]

---
# Create a `README`
* Use standard R Markdown. Setup the infrastructure with `usethis::use_readme_rmd`. 
* Write it just like a normal R Markdown doc and it should all flow into the `README`.

&lt;img src = "img/esvis-README.png" height = 325 /&gt;

---
# Use Travis/Appveyor
* Register for a free account
* Run `usethis::use_travis` and `usethis::use_appveyor` to get started.
  + Go to each respective website and "turn on" the repo
  + Copy and paste the code to the badge into your `README`.
  

--

* Now all your code will be automatically tested on Mac/Linux (Travis CI) and Windows (Appveyor)

&lt;img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzAu2U1tOafteBa0/giphy.gif" height = 200, align = "right" /&gt;


---
# codevoc
You can test your code coverage each time you push a new commit by using [codecov](https://codecov.io). Initialize with `usethis::use_coverage()`. Overall setup process is pretty similar to Travis CI/Appveyor.

Easily see what is/is not covered by tests!
