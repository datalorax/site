I work as a research associate for [Behavioral Research and Teaching](http://www.brtprojects.org), a grant-based center in the College of Education at the University of Oregon. My career in research began in measurement and psychometrics and I still do consulting work in that area. However, my research focus has mostly moved towards data science and the economics of education. In other words, I am interested in the intersection of computer programming and statistics, as applied to large-scale data, to understand macro-level features of the educational system (e.g., large-scale policies, etc.). I am particularly interested in issues of equity in education. This blog, however, is almost entirely focused on my coding work. I teach a class on R and hope to eventually use this website to help illustrate topics, as well as share things I think are interesting/relevant. I work nearly exclusively in R, and the vast majority of the code in this blog is R code. You can see my professional bio [here](http://www.brtprojects.org/employees/daniel-anderson/).
