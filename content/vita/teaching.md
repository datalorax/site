# COE Data Science Specialization
{{% /center %}}

I am currently in the process of leading the development of a [five-course data science specialization in R](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization) for students in the College of Education at the University of Oregon, in collaboration with Drs. [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io), [Chester Ismay](http://ismayc.github.io) and [Andrew Bray](http://andrewpbray.github.io). Although the courses will be offered through the COE, it is anticipated that students from numerous social science departments will have an interest, given past enrollment in the R courses listed below.

### Fall 2018
[EDUC 610: Introduction to Data Science with R](../ds/ds1)

#### Summer 2018
[EDUC 611: Survey of Educational Research Methods](../educ611/educ611)

* This summer I will be teaching this course for the first time. I will post the materials for the course here, as I develop them. The course is aimed at educational practitioners (teachers and administrators), and introduces students to concepts of research design and research methods.  

#### Fall 2017
[EDLD 610: Exploring Data with R](../classr/classr) (4 Credits). CRN: 17214

* Introduces students to the basics of data science with R. Specifically, the course focuses on three key principles of modern exploratory data analysis: (a) programming and reproducible research through R, (b) transforming data to workable formats, and \(c) exploring data visually. The course is taught through the [*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org).

#### Spring 2017
EDLD 610: Exploring Data with R (4 Credits). CRN: 37117

* This was the first iteration of the course by the same name listed above.
